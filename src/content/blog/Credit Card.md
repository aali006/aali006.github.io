## Details:

- Context: The project aims to assist credit card companies in recognizing fraudulent transactions, a critical task to prevent customers from unauthorized charges. Anomaly detection techniques will be implemented to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, initially utilizing machine learning algorithms for prediction, followed by leveraging OpenClassSVM for further analysis.
- Content: The dataset comprises transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It includes transactions that occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.


## Summary:
This Credit Card Fraud Detection Project focuses on utilizing anomaly detection techniques to identify fraudulent transactions accurately. With the dataset containing transactions from European cardholders in September 2013, the project addresses the challenge of highly unbalanced data, with fraudulent transactions being a minority class. By implementing machine learning algorithms and leveraging OpenClassSVM for analysis, the project aims to assist credit card companies in safeguarding their customers from unauthorized charges.
