## Steps Followed:

- Data Preprocessing: Perform one-hot encoding on target classes, read and convert images into NumPy arrays, and normalize the array data.
- Network Architecture Design: Design the CNN model architecture, incorporating layers such as Conv2D for convolutional kernels, MaxPooling2D for downsampling, Flatten for converting input into 1D output, and Dense layers for generating dot product outputs.
- Model Training: Train the model over multiple epochs (e.g., 100 epochs) with a chosen batch size (e.g., 128), monitoring training and validation accuracy to assess model performance. Consider experimenting with different numbers of epochs to potentially enhance accuracy.
- Evaluation: Utilize the predict function to make predictions using the trained model, and assess its accuracy on the test set.

## Summary:
The Dog Breed Prediction project employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to accurately predict dog breeds from images. Following data preprocessing steps including one-hot encoding and normalization, we design the CNN model with appropriate layers for feature extraction and classification. Training the model over multiple epochs allows for learning complex patterns in the data, while continuous monitoring of training and validation accuracy ensures model performance. Finally, the trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its predictive accuracy.
