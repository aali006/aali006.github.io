## Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to develop an app to predict the risk of a heart attack for individuals. Various algorithms will be employed to predict the results, and the performance of each algorithm will be evaluated to determine the most suitable one. Additionally, we will utilize the AutoML library EVAL ML to further enhance the prediction accuracy.

## Project Tasks:

- Data Analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Feature Engineering: Process and manipulate the features to enhance their predictive power.
- Standardization: Standardize the features to ensure uniformity and improve model performance.
- Model Building: Develop predictive models using various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbour, and SVM.
- Predictions: Utilize the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Model Selection:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K Nearest Neighbour
- SVM

## Summary:
This project aims to develop a heart attack risk prediction app using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset containing various patient attributes, we aim to build models capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of a heart attack. Through thorough data analysis, feature engineering, and model building, we seek to create a reliable tool for assessing heart health and improving early detection of potential risks.
