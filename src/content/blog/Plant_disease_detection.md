  Plant Disease Detection with CNN- TensorFlow and Keras Implementation
---



## Steps Followed:

- Introduction: Develop a machine learning model for detecting plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
- Dataset: Utilize a dataset comprising images of plants affected by various diseases. Preprocess the images by converting them into NumPy arrays and normalizing them.
- Model Architecture: Design a CNN model architecture tailored for image classification tasks, incorporating optimized layers for feature extraction and classification.
- Training: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train the model using the training set for a specified number of epochs while monitoring performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's accuracy using the test set. Generate random predictions to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

## Summary:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution for detecting plant diseases using CNNs implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. Leveraging a dataset of images depicting diseased plants, the images are preprocessed and used to train a CNN model. The trained model's accuracy is evaluated on a separate test set, with additional random predictions generated to gauge its performance on unseen data.
