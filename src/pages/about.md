## Let me Introduce


With nearly 2 years of experience in software testing and automation, specializing in data analytics and automation QA within the IT industry. Investigating various usage patterns to understand their effects on Electric Vehicle (EV) battery health, I excel in utilizing machine learning and data analytics to derive valuable insights and predictions. Proficient in Python, Selenium, and various Python libraries for data processing and visualization, I am skilled in developing and implementing advanced machine learning algorithms, such as SVR, Ensemble, and Random Forest, to drive predictive analysis and enhance decision-making processes. Achieving a significant improvement in testing efficiency through the implementation of Selenium automation tools, I have streamlined testing procedures and enhanced productivity. Strong analytical skills enable me to analyze financial data, identify patterns, and implement data-centric resolutions. Furthermore, I have completed an internship at TelioEV on an ML project and have completed various projects on Data Analytics, Regression, Computer Vision, NLP, and Deep Learning. Additionally, I excel in data science, predictive modelling, data interpretation, trend analysis, data mining, ML/DL/NLP, Python programming, pattern recognition, computer vision, and cross-functional coordination.
